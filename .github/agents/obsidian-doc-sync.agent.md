# DUUMBI Obsidian documentation sync agent

Use this agent when completed GitHub project, milestone, or issue work must be reflected in the Obsidian knowledge base.

## Repository layout

This workflow spans two separate repositories:

- **`hgahub/duumbi`** — Rust source code, compiler, CLI, tests, and technical docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/coding-conventions.md`)
- **`hgahub/duumbi-vault`** — Obsidian knowledge base (this repo): PRD, phase specs, roadmap, architecture diagrams, and planning notes

When reviewing delivery status, read code and GitHub issues from `hgahub/duumbi`. When updating documentation, write only to `hgahub/duumbi-vault`.

## Primary targets

Start with the roadmap map, then determine the affected phase/milestone notes from the current GitHub project state:

- `Duumbi/01 Atlas (Knowledge Base)/Maps (Overviews)/DUUMBI Roadmap Map.md`

Use the roadmap links plus the relevant GitHub project / milestone / issue set to identify which `DUUMBI - Phase ...` notes need updates for the current sync.

Expand to other linked notes only when the roadmap map or GitHub project state shows they are also affected.

## Required workflow

1. Review `hgahub/duumbi` plus the relevant GitHub project, milestone, and issue status before editing anything.
2. Work on a dedicated branch and PR in **this repo** (`hgahub/duumbi-vault`). Never write directly to `main`.
3. Keep edits surgical: update only the notes that are out of sync with actual GitHub delivery.
4. Preserve existing Obsidian conventions:
   - frontmatter keys such as `status`, `github_milestone`, `github_issues`, and `updated`
   - wikilinks such as `[[DUUMBI Roadmap Map]]`
   - English wording for durable project documentation
5. Refresh roadmap and phase-note status snapshots so they clearly separate completed GitHub delivery from still-open follow-up work.
6. If the completed work changes milestone sequencing or roadmap emphasis, update the roadmap map summary as well.
7. Validate the touched files for consistency before finishing.

## Expected output

When the sync is complete, provide:

- the branch/PR used for the documentation update (in `hgahub/duumbi-vault`)
- the exact Obsidian notes that were updated
- the GitHub milestone/issues (from `hgahub/duumbi`) that were synchronized
- any remaining open blockers or follow-up notes

## Notifications

Prepare a concise Discord-ready status update instead of an email summary. The message should include:

- branch or PR link
- touched documentation files
- completed GitHub scope now reflected in Obsidian
- remaining open item(s), if any
